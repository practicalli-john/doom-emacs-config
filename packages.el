;; To install a package with Doom you must declare them here and run 'doom sync'
;; on the command line, then restart Emacs for the changes to take effect -- or
;; use 'M-x doom/reload'.


;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
;(package! some-package)

;; To install a package directly from a remote git repo, you must specify a
;; `:recipe'. You'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
;; https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el#the-recipe-format
;(package! another-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))

;; If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
;; file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
;; `:files' in the `:recipe':
;(package! this-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
;           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))

;; If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, you can do so here
;; with the `:disable' property:
;(package! builtin-package :disable t)

;; You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
;; all the properties for `:recipe'. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
;; from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
;(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))

;; Specify a `:branch' to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
;; This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
;; our package manager can't deal with; see radian-software/straight.el#279)
;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))

;; Use `:pin' to specify a particular commit to install.
;(package! builtin-package :pin "1a2b3c4d5e")


;; Doom's packages are pinned to a specific commit and updated from release to
;; release. The `unpin!' macro allows you to unpin single packages...
;(unpin! pinned-package)
;; ...or multiple packages
;(unpin! pinned-package another-pinned-package)
;; ...Or *all* packages (NOT RECOMMENDED; will likely break things)
;(unpin! t)

;; Use the latest available packages for Clojure
;; - cider, clojure-mode
(unpin! (:lang clojure))

;; Koacha test runner in Emacs
(package! kaocha-runner)
(package! clojure-snippets)
(package! clj-ns-name
  :recipe (:host github :repo "corgi-emacs/clj-ns-name" :files ("clj-ns-name.el")))
(package! pprint-to-buffer
  :recipe (:host github :repo "plexus/plexmacs" :files ("pprint-to-buffer/pprint-to-buffer.el")))
(package! fennel-mode)

;; Keycast
;; latest release 2020-11-17
(package! keycast :pin "16d9961d15536054632be1eff75fd0fb1a4420f8")

(package! deadgrep)
;; Very large files mode loads large files in chunks to open ridiculously large files.

;; (package! vlf :recipe (:host github :repo "m00natic/vlfi" :files ("*.el"))
;;   :pin "cc02f2533782d6b9b628cec7e2dcf25b2d05a27c" :disable t)
